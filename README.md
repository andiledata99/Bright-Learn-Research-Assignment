# Bright-Learn-Research-Assignment
Database Research Assignment – Andile Dube
This repository contains my Research Assignment 1, where I explored foundational and advanced concepts in databases, SQL, and data management. The work is divided into three sections: Database Fundamentals, SQL & Data Processing, and Cloud vs On-Premise Database Management.
The assignment demonstrates my ability to understand, analyze, and apply database concepts in real-world scenarios.

🚀 Knowledge Gained
🔹 Section A – Database Fundamentals
• 	Types of Databases → Structured, Semi-structured, and Unstructured data
• 	Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) → Tables, rows, columns, and relationships
• 	Keys → Primary keys (unique identifiers) and foreign keys (relationships between tables)
• 	Data Normalization → Reducing redundancy, improving performance, and ensuring consistency
• 	Schemas → Defining database structure and relationships
• 	Fact vs Dimension Tables → Facts measure business performance; dimensions provide descriptive context
• 	Data Models → Conceptual blueprints for organizing and scaling databases
• 	Database vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake
• 	Database → Transactional, schema-driven (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
• 	Data Warehouse → Historical, analytical, schema-on-read (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery)
• 	Data Lake → Raw, unprocessed, flexible storage (e.g., Hadoop, Amazon S3)
• 	Data Marts → Departmental subsets of data warehouses for faster, simplified analytics

🔹 Section B – SQL & Data Processing
• 	SQL as a Query Language → Standardized, portable, flexible, widely adopted
• 	Indexes → Improving query speed and reducing I/O operations
• 	Transactions & ACID Properties → Ensuring reliability, consistency, and durability of operations
• 	Database Engines (DBMS) → Managing queries, concurrency, and scalability
• 	Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers → Virtual tables, modular SQL, and automated actions
• 	ETL vs ELT → Transformation before vs after loading data
• 	Batch vs Stream Processing
• 	Batch → Scheduled, high-throughput
• 	Stream → Real-time, low latency
• 	Joins → Inner, Left, Right, Full Outer, Cross, and Self Joins
• 	Referential Integrity → Ensuring valid relationships between tables
• 	Data Redundancy → Challenges with storage, performance, and anomalies

🔹 Section C – Cloud vs On-Premise Database Management
• 	Cloud vs On-Premise Differences
• 	Location → Cloud (internet-based) vs On-site (local servers)
• 	Scalability → Cloud is elastic; on-premise requires hardware upgrades
• 	Cost → Cloud is pay-as-you-go; on-premise has high upfront costs
• 	Accessibility → Cloud enables remote/global access; on-premise is limited
• 	Maintenance → Cloud providers manage updates; on-premise requires IT staff
• 	Data Governance → Policies ensuring accuracy, consistency, and security
• 	Data Integrity → Reliability of data across systems and lifecycle
• 	Data Quality → Accuracy, completeness, and fitness for analytics
• 	Roles in Database Management
• 	Data Analyst → Collection, cleaning, modeling, visualization, reporting, storytelling
• 	Database Administrator (DBA) → Design, performance, security, backup/recovery, troubleshooting
• 	Data Pipelines → Requirements, ingestion, processing, storage, output, deployment, monitoring
• 	Challenges in Large-Scale Data Management → Scalability, performance, security, integrity, backup, concurrency, integration, cost
• 	Popular Database Platforms → MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Aurora, Snowflake, Oracle
• 	Use Cases → Web apps, big data analytics, real-time processing, IoT storage, AI/ML, e-commerce, CMS
• 	Data Storage Formats → CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, XML, time-series formats

🛠️ Skills Strengthened
• 	Database Design & Modeling
• 	SQL Query Writing & Optimization
• 	Data Warehousing & Analytics Concepts
• 	ETL/ELT & Data Pipeline Design
• 	Cloud vs On-Premise Database Management
• 	Data Governance, Integrity, and Quality Assurance
• 	Business Intelligence Applications
